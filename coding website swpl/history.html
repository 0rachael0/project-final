    The Scottish Women's Football League
     was formed in 1999. In 2002 the top 
    division broke away to form the SWPL,
    with an aim for the league to become 
    more professional. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The twelve founding members of the SWPL
    were Ayr United, Cove Rangers, Dundee,
    Giulianos, Glasgow City, Hamilton Academical,
    Hibernian, Inver-Ross, FC Kilmarnock,
    Lossiemouth, Raith Rovers and Shettleston.
    </p>
    <p>
    Up until 2011 each team played each other twice.
    In 2016 the SWPL split into SWPL1 and SWPL2
    with each league having 8 teams. Teams in the SWPL1
    play each other three times and the team at the bottom
    of the table is relegated to SWPL2.
    </p>
    <p>
    Glasgow City are the most successful team in the SWPL.
    They have won 14 titles, 13 of which were in a row. 
    They have won the Scottish Cup 9 times and the League
    Cup 6 times.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hibs are the most successful team in the League Cup,
    having won it 7 times.
    </p>
    <p>
    Starting in 2018, BBC ALBA started showing a select amount of SWPL 
    games, as well as the Scottish Cup and League Cup finals.
    <br>
    In 2020 it was announced that BBC Sport Scotland would be
    streaming one game every Sunday via their online platform.
